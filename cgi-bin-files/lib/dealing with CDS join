Additional comments since extension.
Although initially I felt strongly that I had completed my part of the project in time and others in my group had not so I would not make any further additions I eventually realised these frustrations are probably a common occurrence for programmers and worked on my code to incorporate the changes such as a programme to deal with CDS join. 
There was more communication during this week particularly between Archana and I felt I got to experience more of a ‘development cycle’. Archana and I would take it in turns to work on our code and when I reached a limitation I fed this information back to Archana who would then make edits to her data access layer. One example of this is that I realised searching the DB on ‘gene’ returned multiple records. We required a function to be able to search on Accession number which Archana then created. As developers probably often do work at varying speeds and different times of day it is important to manage time well so that there is enough time to complete projects by deadlines - taking in to account time spent waiting for other parts of a project to feedback. 
I asked if front end could provide some clear expectations or perhaps an outline of what their front ends would look like during this week so that I could check my layer was returning all data required. I hadn’t seen a mock up or had any feedback so assumed what was being returned was acceptable.
